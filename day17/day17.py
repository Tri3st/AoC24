# There are two types of operands; each instruction specifies the type of its operand.
# The value of a literal operand is the operand itself. For example, the value of the literal operand 7 is the number 7.
#
# The value of a combo operand can be found as follows:
#
# Combo operands 0 through 3 represent literal values 0 through 3.
# Combo operand 4 represents the value of register A.
# Combo operand 5 represents the value of register B.
# Combo operand 6 represents the value of register C.
# Combo operand 7 is reserved and will not appear in valid programs.
# The eight instructions are as follows:
#
# The adv instruction (opcode 0) performs division. The numerator is the value in the A register. The denominator is found by raising 2 to the power of the instruction's combo operand. (So, an operand of 2 would divide A by 4 (2^2); an operand of 5 would divide A by 2^B.) The result of the division operation is truncated to an integer and then written to the A register.
# The bxl instruction (opcode 1) calculates the bitwise XOR of register B and the instruction's literal operand, then stores the result in register B.
# The bst instruction (opcode 2) calculates the value of its combo operand modulo 8 (thereby keeping only its lowest 3 bits), then writes that value to the B register.
# The jnz instruction (opcode 3) does nothing if the A register is 0. However, if the A register is not zero, it jumps by setting the instruction pointer to the value of its literal operand; if this instruction jumps, the instruction pointer is not increased by 2 after this instruction.
# The bxc instruction (opcode 4) calculates the bitwise XOR of register B and register C, then stores the result in register B. (For legacy reasons, this instruction reads an operand but ignores it.)
# The out instruction (opcode 5) calculates the value of its combo operand modulo 8, then outputs that value. (If a program outputs multiple values, they are separated by commas.)
# The bdv instruction (opcode 6) works exactly like the adv instruction except that the result is stored in the B register. (The numerator is still read from the A register.)
# The cdv instruction (opcode 7) works exactly like the adv instruction except that the result is stored in the C register. (The numerator is still read from the A register.)
